# Ayiti_analytics_capstone_project
I want to know what degree or level of education that offer more opportunity or that have most in demand, what skills are employers looking for?
This lead me to explore the backgrounds, experiences, and skills of different professional in Haiti.  For this project I want to study the profile of different professionals, and their evolution after graduation. I want to look at their background, the skills they have acquired, and the opportunities they have had. 
This project is about scrapping Linkedin to build a dataset for different profile of professionals in Haiti. LinkedIn is a social network for professionals making it the Facebook for your career. This platform is the best for networking and connecting with others within your industry or an industry the user may be trying to enter. Not only is this platform great for social networking but it's also great for job searches! That's why I decided to do my web-scraping project on LinkedIn.

I will use selenium and beautiful soup to web-scrape different LinkedIn profile of people in Haiti.
